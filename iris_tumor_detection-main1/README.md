# Iris_tumor_detection_using_cnn

This project focuses on developing a robust and efficient deep learning model to detect iris tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Leveraging the power of neural networks, the model is designed to classify and identify the presence of tumors in iris images with high accuracy. The project aims to contribute towards advancements in medical imaging and diagnostics by offering a reliable tool for early detection and analysis.


## Features

**Automated Detection** : Utilizes CNN to analyze and classify iris images for tumor presence.

**High Accuracy**: Designed to achieve superior accuracy using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

**Scalable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets with minor modifications.

**End-to-End Workflow**: Includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.


## Technology used
1.Python: Programming language for implementation.

2.TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN model.

3.OpenCV: For image preprocessing and augmentation.

4.NumPy and Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

## Components and Subsystems
1.Frontend: Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and view results.

2.Backend: Hosts the CNN model and handles data processing, image validation, and tumor detection logic.

3.Database: Stores uploaded images, user information, and detection results for future reference or analysis.
